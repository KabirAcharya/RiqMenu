# RiqMenu

A simple RIQ menu for Bits & Bops. Currently for Windows only, but MacOS/Linux support is planned very soon.

## Usage

- Install [BepInEx](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) into Bits & Bops Alpha.
- Place your `.riq` files into `Steam\steamapps\common\Bits & Bops Demo\Bits & Bops_Data\StreamingAssets`.
- Place the `RiqMenu.dll` file into `Steam\steamapps\common\Bits & Bops Demo\BepInEx\plugins\` for Windows.
- Launch the game and select `Custom Songs` from the title screen to open the menu.
- Hold `P` for autoplay.
- Select the level you would like to play.
- Press `R` to quick restart a level.
