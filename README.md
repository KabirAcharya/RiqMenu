# RiqMenu

A simple RIQ menu for Bits & Bops. Currently for Windows only, but MacOS/Linux support is planned very soon.

## Usage

- Install [BepInEx](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) into Bits & Bops Alpha.
- Place your `.riq` files into `Steam\steamapps\common\Bits & Bops Demo\Bits & Bops_Data\StreamingAssets`.
- Place the `RiqMenu.dll` file into `Steam\steamapps\common\Bits & Bops Demo\BepInEx\plugins\` for Windows.
- Launch the game and select `Custom Songs` from the title screen or press `F1` to toggle the menu.
- Navigate songs with `↑`/`↓` arrow keys or `W`/`S` keys
- Use `Page Up`/`Page Down` for faster navigation
- Press `Enter` or `Space` to select and play a song
- Press `P` to toggle autoplay mode (shows green/red status in menu)
- Press `Escape` or `F1` to close the menu
- Press `F2` to stop audio preview
